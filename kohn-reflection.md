# Reflection on Kohn's Article
I'm in agreement with Alfie Kohn's insights on the effect that grades have on the learning process of an individual.
According to Kohn, grades do have a detrimental effect on the learning process.
When emphasis is placed on the grade that an individual gets, the focus gets detered from what really matters. What really matters is the skill that a person gets and not the grade.
Over time, we have seen people who performed really well at school struggling in their places of work. 
This is because they focused on attaining good grades while at school and not on actually acquiring the skills needed to ace it at the job market.


Personally, I performed quite well in my undergraduate. 
However, upon completing my undergraduate, I struggled a bit in landing a job because I didn't really have the skills needed to actually do the jobs I was seeking.
In my undergraduate, I read to do well in my exams and not to acually understand the concepts that were being taught.
I remember in a certain class in my final year where I scored an A, however, I didn't really gain a good understanding of what the course was all about.
The professor had told us where the exam was going to come from, so I did spend most of my time cramming the content that was going to be set.
I chose the easy way out by concentrating on the area that the professor had pointed out, instead of going through the course and gaining valuable insights from it.
The fortunate bit is that I scored highly in that class, however, the unfortunate bit is that I didn't gain the skils that I needed to gain from that class.
Thus, I felt like I didn't deserve the high grade that I got.


I do believe that grades are not an actual representation of someone's abilities. 
As Kohn indicates in his article, grades affect the thinking of students in a negative way.
Instead of the student reading the course content to gain insight and understanding, 
the student goes through the course content to try and figure out sections of the course that would be tested in the exam.
In my opinion, I believe that grades insinuates that the end justifies the means. 
Meaning that the grade you do get at the end of the learning process is a good representation of your prowess in that course.
However, in the learning process, I don't believe that the end should justify the means. 
I believe that every aspect of a student's learning process should be taken into consideration when pointing out a student's ability.
Therefore, I share the same opinion as Kohn, that grades should be removed from courses.


If grades were removed from courses, my main motivation would be to obtain the skills being offered in those courses.
I did learn after completing my undergraduate that employers look for people who can actually do the job and not those who scored highly in school.
The skills that you have to offer are what matters to employers and not your grades.
When it comes to accomplishing a task, your knowledge and experience in handling that task will come in handy and not the grades that you got in school.
Therefore, my main motivation will be to obtain skills from the course that would help me in achieving my career goals.
